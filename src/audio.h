/* Concerning the 'pos' parameter:
 *   RGSS3 actually doesn't specify a format for this,
 *   it's only implied that it is a numerical value
 *   (must be 0 on invalid cases), and it's not used for
 *   anything outside passing it back into bgm/bgs_play.
 *   We use this freedom to define pos to be a float,
 *   in seconds of playback. (RGSS3 seems to use large
 *   integers that _look_ like sample offsets but I can't
 *   quite make out their meaning yet) */
