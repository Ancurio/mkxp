# About filesystem paths specified in this config:
# The "gameFolder" path is resolved either relative
# to the directory containing the mkxp executable
# (the default behavior), or relative to the current
# working directory (when compiled with 
# -DWORKDIR_CURRENT). All other paths are resolved
# relative to gameFolder and ignoring both RTPs and
# encrypted archives.


# Specify the RGSS version to run under.
# Possible values are 0, 1, 2, 3. If set to 0,
# mkxp will try to guess the required version
# based on the game files found in gameFolder.
# If this fails, the version defaults to 1.
# (default: 0)
#
# rgssVersion=1


# Create a debug context and log
# OpenGL debug information to the console
# (default: disabled)

# debugMode=false


# Continuously print average FPS to console.
# This setting does not affect the window title
# FPS display toggled via F2
# (default: disabled)
#
# printFPS=false


# Game window is resizable
# (default: disabled)
#
# winResizable=false


# Start game in fullscreen (this can
# always be toggled with Alt-Enter at runtime)
# (default: disabled)

# Specify the window width on startup. If set to 0,
# it will default to the default resolution width
# specific to  the RGSS version (640 in RGSS1, 544
# in RGSS2 or higher).
# (default: 0)
#
# defScreenW=640


# Specify the window height on startup. If set to 0,
# it will default to the default resolution height
# specific to the RGSS version (480 in RGSS1, 416
# in RGSS2 or higher).
# (default: 0)

# Enforce a static frame rate
# (0 = disabled)
#
# fixedFramerate=0


# Skip (don't draw) frames when behind
# (default: enabled)
#
# frameSkip=true


# Use a fixed framerate that is approx. equal to the
# native screen refresh rate. This is different from
# "fixedFramerate" because the actual frame rate is
# reported back to the game, ensuring correct timers.
# If the screen refresh rate cannot be determined,
# this option is force-disabled
# (default: disabled)
#
# syncToRefreshrate=false


# Don't use alpha blending when rendering text
# (default: disabled)

# Work around buggy graphics drivers which don't
# properly synchronize texture access, most
# apparent when text doesn't show up or the map
# tileset doesn't render at all

# Enable framebuffer blitting if the driver is
# capable of it. Some drivers carry buggy
# implementations of this functionality, so
# disabling it can be used as a workaround
# (default: enabled)
#
# enableBlitting=true


# Limit the maximum size (width, height) of
# most textures mkxp will create (exceptions are
# rendering backbuffers and similar).
# If set to 0, the hardware maximum is used.
# This is useful for recording traces that can
# be played back on machines with lower specs.
# (default: 0)

# Set the base path of the game to '/path/to/game'

# Organisation / company and application / game

# (default: disabled)
#
# useScriptNames=false


# Font substitutions allow drop-in replacements of fonts
# to be used without changing the RGSS scripts,
# eg. providing 'Open Sans' when the game thinkgs it's
# using 'Arial'. Font family to be substituted and
# replacement family are separated by one sole '>'.
# Be careful not to include any spaces.
# This is not connected to the built-in font, which is
# always used when a non-existing font family is
# requested by RGSS.
# (default: none)
#
# fontSub=Arial>Open Sans
# fontSub=Times New Roman>Liberation Serif


# Because mkxp is usually distributed as a stand alone
# build, no predefined load paths are initialized
# ($:, $LOAD_PATH) in the MRI backend. With this option,
# they can be specified manually (eg. when using a system
# libruby.so). It is however recommended to statically
# link all required gems into libruby.so.

# The Windows game executable name minus ".exe". By default
# this is "Game", but some developers manually rename it.
# mkxp needs this name because both the .ini (game
# configuration) and .rgssad (encrypted data archive) must
# carry the same name minus their extension, and we cannot
# guess the executable's name.
# You could just as well rename them both to "Game.ini" and
# "Game.rgssad", but specifying the executable name here
# is a tiny bit less intrusive.
#
# execName=Game


# Give a hint on which language the game title as
# specified in the Game.ini is, useful if the encoding
# is being falsely detected. Relevant only if mkxp was
# built with automatic encoding conversion (INI_ENCODING).
